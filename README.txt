• No body/layout/scripts were modified.

How to use (GitHub web)
-----------------------
1) Open your repository → “Add file” → “Upload files”.
2) Upload ALL of these files/folders to the ROOT of your repo (replace existing files when asked).
3) Commit changes.

After upload (recommended)
--------------------------
• In Google Search Console → URL Inspection → https://mojaf-sa.com/ → Request indexing.

• Share your homepage link once on your GBP or social to create a crawl path.

Notes
-----
• Meta keywords are included because you requested them; Google ignores this tag, but it's harmless.
• Rankings depend on competition and links; this pack focuses on fast discoverability and relevance.
