This guide helps non-technical users ensure the website ranks fast and crawls correctly.

## Step 1: Upload Files
1. Upload the entire ZIP contents to your hosting server (usually in `public_html` folder).
2. Ensure `index.html` is the homepage.

## Step 2: Sitemap Submission
1. Go to Google Search Console.
2. Add your domain (https://www.mojaf-sa.com).
3. Upload `sitemap.xml` under Index > Sitemaps.
4. This helps Google crawl all pages faster.

## Step 3: Basic SEO Checks
- Titles and meta descriptions are already added to all pages.
- Images have alt text for SEO.

- Header/footer and internal links are set for proper navigation.

## Step 4: Speed Optimization
- Use hosting with caching (LiteSpeed or similar).
- Compress images if you add new ones.
- Avoid uploading heavy unoptimized pictures.

## Step 5: Tracking & Updates
- Create a free Google Analytics account and connect it.
- Add new blog posts regularly (every 2–4 weeks) with KSA construction keywords.
- Ask customers for reviews and link to your Google Business Profile.

## Step 6: Monitor Ranking
- Check your ranking in Google Search Console weekly.
- Update keywords if some pages are not showing.

Following these steps ensures Google crawls your site quickly and improves ranking over time.


## Menu linking (already done for you)
- Blog has been added to both header and footer menus across pages where a nav or footer exists.
- If a page doesn’t have a nav/footer block, it stays untouched. You can copy the header/footer from index.html if needed.
